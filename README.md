# common_longish_safe
This list is specifically created to use in generating passphrases (see https://xkcd.com/936/). It has four criteria applied:

* The words are in English
* The words are 5 or more characters long
* The words are SFW (no four letter words anyway, as per rule #2)
* The words are filtered against a list of the 3000 most commonly used words, so we avoid keysmash words

There are 1470 words in the list.
